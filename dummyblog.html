    <h1>Coming Sooon. Blog on site.</h1>
    <p>
      This is a dummy blog. This will be replaced by a real blog soon. Read on
      to know how i made this blog page. I added a new file in my VSCode and
      linked it to the primary link on my blogs web page. Further, i will write
      some content on this page and keep it simple so that it becomes a blog
      which is a part of our website and opens in our website only. It will not
      be an externally connected link that will take you to some other website.
      So sit back and relax and have a pina colada in the winters. Now i am just
      writing to fill up the 150 words requirement for this dummy blog. Have a
      good day. Ohh noo, i will have to add few more words just to fill the
      words requirement. The last time i checked it was around 135 words,
      hopefully now it is 150+. If not then i will write more. Going to check
      now! Cheers!
