          After completing <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> from
          <strong>Delhi College of Engineering</strong> in 2019 I started
          working in an operations firm. And 6 months down the line I didn't
          enjoy that work much and I left that job in pursuit of something else.
          Then came the coronavirus and changed the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was during this time when I decided that why not explore something
          which I thought I could never do. It was Coding, and I came across
          <strong>Neog.Camp</strong>. Now I am learning
          <strong>Full Stack Web Dev</strong> with neog.camp. Till now the
          journey has been fantastic.

          In the four years of Engineering I was an active figure in the
          sporting community of my university. Being the
          <strong>Treasurer</strong> of <strong>Sports Council</strong> of
          <strong>DTU.</strong> I was bestowed upon with a lot of
          responsibilities involving high monetary exchanges whether it be in
          the form of development of sporting facilities in the University
          premises or to conudct all India level sports fests.

        <p>
          I published a research paper on the Tribological Analysis of a Cricket
          Ball with respect to a Cricket Pitch in my final year. It was also my
          final year major project done under the guidance of my mentor Dr. R.C.
          Singh.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from participating in various college events I played
          prestigious club cricket in the DDCA league of Delhi and also
          represented our University in All India University (AIU) Sports
          tournament.

        <p>
          All in all, over the course of 4 years along with all my co-curricular
          activites I managed to secure an
          <strong>aggregate percentage</strong> of <strong>75.7% </strong>.

          All my school life I took part in one acitivity or some other.
          Staybacks was a common thing for me. From theatre to sports to quiz
          competitions. I was always up for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I served in the executive committee of our senior school overtaking
          various responsibilities. In school, due to my burning passion for
          cricket I was given the sports portfolio.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another activity which instilled confidence in me to face anybody was
          Theatre. I truly believe in Shakespeare's quote, "All the world's a
          stage!". I participated and won in many inter-school level street and
          stage plays.
        </p>

        <p>
          I secured <strong>94.8% </strong>in my
          <strong> CBSE 12th standard board exams</strong>
